ðŸ“š I am currently studying at <b>The Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science</b> in Bucharest.

My main interests are <b>IT engineering, software & Web development</b>, passions that I have developed during my first two years of university when I got the chance to create impressive projects in programming languages such as: <b>Java, Python, C and Assembly</b>, as well as through extracurricular trainings and courses I have attended.

The interaction with these programming languages had a big impact in my development, since I have improved the ability to identify, formulate and solve engineering problems.

My biggest passion is represented by ðŸ’» <b>Web Development</b>, which is the subject that helped me improve my analytical skills, creative thinking and problem solving skills. I strongly believe that Web Development is the perfect way to combine both design and programming.

I am also passionate about universal literature and psychology, spending my leisure time reading. I take great pleasure in interacting with my fellows and I consider myself very sociable, as I prefer teamwork and interaction.
