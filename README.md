I am currently studying at The Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science in Bucharest.

My main interests are IT engineering, software & Web development, passions that I have developed during my first two years of university when I got the chance to create impressive projects in programming languages such as: Java, Python, C and Assembly, as well as through extracurricular trainings and courses I have attended.

The interaction with these programming languages had a big impact in my development, since I have improved the ability to identify, formulate and solve engineering problems.

My biggest passion is represented by Web Development, which is the subject that helped me improve my analytical skills, creative thinking and problem solving skills. I strongly believe that Web Development is the perfect way to combine both design and programming.

I am also passionate about universal literature and psychology, spending my leisure time reading. I take great pleasure in interacting with my fellows and I consider myself very sociable, as I prefer teamwork and interaction.
