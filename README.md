üë©‚Äçüíª About Me

I‚Äôm a Full Stack Software Engineer with a strong foundation in Java, Spring Boot, and Angular, currently working at Ford on the API Cybersecurity Team. I focus on building secure, scalable APIs, automating security workflows, and deploying cloud-native services using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Terraform, and Tekton.

At Ford, I independently migrated the frontend codebase to Angular 17, reducing technical debt and improving performance across internal platforms. I contributed to major platform upgrades including Azure Entra ID, Apigee, and cluster migrations, helping standardize and secure API infrastructure. I also implemented automated vulnerability scanning and compliance checks using tools like 42Crunch, Checkmarx, FOSSA, JFrog, and Cycode, improving security coverage across multiple teams. Additionally, I developed internal tools using the Jira API and Microsoft Teams API to improve workflow visibility and reduce manual effort.

Previously at BNP Paribas, I developed an instant payment application using Java EE and JBoss EAP, handled production incidents with Splunk and SQL*Plus, and helped increase test coverage by up to 80% using Mockito, PowerMock, and SonarQube. As an intern, I built a full stack web application using Spring Boot, AngularJS, and Hibernate, gaining hands-on experience with enterprise development and deployment using Liberty.

My background includes:<br>
‚óºÔ∏è Backend development with Java, Spring Boot, Java EE, JBoss EAP, and REST/SOAP APIs<br>
‚óºÔ∏è Frontend development with Angular (JS‚Äì17), TypeScript, HTML, and CSS<br>
‚óºÔ∏è Cloud & CI/CD using GCP, Terraform, Tekton, Jenkins, and Maven<br>
‚óºÔ∏è Strong emphasis on API security and system reliability<br>
‚óºÔ∏è Comfortable with tools and platforms like Hibernate, ElasticSearch, Git, Splunk, Nexus, and ServiceNow<br>
